Advanced Alchemy		KEY:Alchemist Class Feature ~ Advanced Alchemy		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Alchemist Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (see page 162), even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four additional common 1st-level alchemical formulas that feat grants. The list of alchemical items begins on page 360. You can use this feat to create common alchemical items as long as you have their formulas in your formula book, though their power is fleeting. You can create these items in two different ways, as described below. An alchemical item you create this way has the infused trait. First, during your daily preparations (described on page 332), you can create items for which you have the formulas. Creating items in this way requires spending 1 Resonance Point to create a batch of alchemical items of that type with the infused trait. You select how many items are in the batch, up to half the normal maximum batch size (half a typical batch is two items, but see the Crafting Trained Activities section on page for more information). You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items and any requirements of alchemical reagents. You can't overspend Resonance Points to create infused items in this way during your daily preparations. Second, you can create alchemical items with the Quick Alchemy action, described below.

Each time you gain a new level, you can add formulas for two alchemical items to your formula book. These can be of any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy other formulas, or to invent them with the Inventor feat (see page 167).

# TOTEMS
# As a barbarian, you channel the power of your rage through a totem. Traditionally, this is a spiritual or tribal symbol, but you choose what your totem means to you; it might describe a purely internal source or filter of your rage, such as a belief, curse, exotic heritage, or state of mind. Each totem grants you a totem ability, plus more abilities you can gain via totem feats, and it determines what types of damage you resist with the raging resistance class feature. Each totem lists acts that are anathema to it. Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the totem's power and any totem feats until you spend 1 day of downtime recentering yourself, though you keep all other barbarian abilities.

Whether you're a member of a superstitious tribe that distrusts magic, a survivor of a magical accident that left your mind and body with an intense aversion to magic, or a scion of a bloodline known for its magic resistance, your rage is inimical to magic. This makes you an excellent mage hunter but slow to trust practitioners of magical arts. Your extremely restrictive anathema grants you powers beyond those of other totems.

When you are wielding such a weapon in combat, double your conditional bonus to damage rolls from raging, but you have the sluggish 1 condition (see page 324) because of the weapon's unwieldy size.

If an ally insists on using magic on you despite your unwillingness, and you have no reason to believe they will stop, continuing to travel with that ally counts as willingly accepting their spells (as do similar circumstances) and thus is also anathema to your totem.

Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for your Verbal Casting actions rather than speaking. Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. The number of spells you can cast each day are called your spell slots. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table on page 65. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.

A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a bard. For example, as a 1stlevel bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level bard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Spell Repertoire		KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Spell Repertoire			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell of your choice and four occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells on the occult spell list in this book (see page 200) or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot from Table 3-6, you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. So when you reach 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and at 4th level you select a 2nd-level spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.	DESC:&nl;Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire - As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you level up and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime (see page 318).
First Compositions	KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ First Compositions		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Compositions are a special type of spell that require you to use the Performance skill as a part of their casting. At 1st level, bards gain two types of composition spells: composition cantrips and composition powers (which both have the composition trait). You gain the inspire courage composition cantrip (see page 233), which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear. This is in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list. Feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out compositions gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining (see page 318). You can also cast a composition power called counter performance (see page 212) that protects against auditory and visual effects. You have a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast this spell. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points during your daily preparations. You can cast counter performance only by spending 1 Spell Point, not using spell slots. This power is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Some bard feats let you learn more composition powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points.
Muses				KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Muses				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:As a bard, you have a muse that leads you to great things, which might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or something more nebulous. While there are nearly as many different muses as there are bards, muses grant a limited number of different abilities to bards based on their theme.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Bard Muses|1
Bard Feats			KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Bard Feats				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain a bard class feat (see page 66). You gain another at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th, and 20th levels.
Skill Feats			KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Skill Feats			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
Spontaneous Heightening	KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ Spontaneous Heightening	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You learn to freely heighten some of your spells, even if you know only the base version of the spell. During your daily preparations (see page 192), you can select up to two spells you know. You can cast those spells using any applicable higher-level spell slots you have, heightening the spell to the level of spell slot used, even if you don't ordinarily know the spell at the higher level.
General Feats		KEY:Bard Class Feature ~ General Feats			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.

You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.

# Cleric
Divine Spellcasting		KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Divine Spellcasting					CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You have the power to cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Spellcasting on page 195). Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol or a religious text) as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components or another hand free. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in this book (see page 200) or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown on the Cleric Spells per Day table on page 70. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells		KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells					CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can prepare lower-level spells in those slots to strengthen them. This increases the spell's level to match the heightened spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (see page 192).
Cantrips				KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Cantrips							CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level cleric, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Deity and Domain			KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Deity and Domain						CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Choose one deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on Table 3-9: Deities on pages 72-73. This table lists each deity's name, areas of concern, and alignment, followed by the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in parentheses after the deity's alignment. Your deity grants you a signature skill and the trained proficiency rank with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. When preparing spells, you can select from these in addition to the spells on the divine list once you can cast that level of spell. Select one domain-a subject of particular interest to you within the traditions of your religion-from your deity's list of domains. This domain grants you a special kind of spell called a domain power. Each domain's theme and powers appear in Table 3-10: Domains on page 73. By choosing a domain, you gain a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast domain powers. You can cast domain powers only by spending Spell Points, not by using spell slots. Your maximum number of Spell Points equals your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells. You gain the initial power tied to your domain when you select the domain. Your initial domain power costs 1 Spell Point to cast and is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Domain powers are available only to characters who've selected the domain and can't be learned by others. Some cleric feats grant you more domain powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points. You can learn additional powers, called advanced domain powers, by taking the Advanced Domain cleric feat. The Spell Point cost of this advanced domain power is listed in parentheses after its name in Table 3-10: Domains.
Anathema				KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Anathema							CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Committing acts, learning or casting spells, and using items that are anathema to your deity take you out of that deity's good graces. Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities and casting lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn't limited this way, but their alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to enhance your ability to lie would be anathema to Sarenrae, as a goddess of honesty, and casting one to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine whether other acts count as anathema. For example, Torag is a god of community, so actions that work to destroy a close-knit community are typically anathema to Torag. However, as god of dwarves, he might permit you to destroy a community of giants that is threatening to wipe out a dwarven settlement. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include channel energy, domain powers, and divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275).
Channel Energy			KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Channel Energy						CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You gain a pool of positive or negative energy, depending on your deity, as shown on Table 3-9: Deities on pages 72-73. Some deities allow you to choose whether to channel negative or positive energy. Once you choose, you can't change the type of energy you channel, short of an ethical shift or divine intervention. This pool of energy allows you to cast either the heal spell (for positive energy) or the harm spell (for negative energy) a number of times per day equal to 3 plus your Charisma modifier without needing to prepare the spell in advance. All spells you cast in this way are heightened to the maximum spell level you can cast as a cleric. You can find heal on page 229 and harm on page 228.
Cleric Feats			KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Cleric Feats						CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain a cleric class feat (see page 74). You gain another at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th, and 20th levels.
Skill Feats				KEY:Cleric Class Feature ~ Skill Feats							CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.

# Druid
Primal Spellcasting		KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Primal Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You have the power to cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Casting Spells on page 195). Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) as part of your Material Casting and Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components or another hand free. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list in this book (see page 201), or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown on the Druid Spells per Day table on page 81. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells		KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can prepare lower-level spells in those slots to strengthen them. This increases the spell's level to match the heightened spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (see page 192).
Cantrips				KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Cantrips						CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a druid. For example, as a 1st-level druid, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level druid, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Anathema				KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Anathema						CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275). The following acts are anathema to all druids: • Using metal armor or shields. • Despoiling natural places. • Teaching the Druidic language to nondruids. Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts.
Druidic Order			KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Druidic Order					CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order power (see below), and an additional signature skill tied to your order. Though you can still gain class feats tied to other orders as you advance, you receive additional benefits when using abilities tied to your chosen order. You gain a pool of Spell Points. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier. You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells (see Daily Preparations on page 192). You also gain a special spell tied to your order, which is called an order power. You cast this order power by spending 1 Spell Point, not by using spell slots. Your order power is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Some druid feats grant you more order powers and increase your pool of Spell Points. The druidic orders presented in this book are as follows.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Druidic Order|1
Druidic Language			KEY:Druid Class Feature ~ Druidic Language					CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You know Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. If you use sign languages instead of spoken languages, you know the sign language version of Druidic. Teaching the Druidic language to nondruids is anathema (see page 80).

# Paladin
Code of Conduct		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Code of Conduct	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Paladins are divine champions of a deity. You must be lawful good and worship a deity that allows lawful good clerics. See the list of deities on page 72. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each deity's entry. You and your GM will determine whether other acts count as anathema. In addition, you must follow the paladin's code below. Deities often add additional strictures for their own paladins (for instance, Shelyn's paladins never attack first except to protect an innocent, and they choose and perfect an art form). If you stray from lawful good, perform acts anathema to your deity, or violate your code of conduct, you lose your Spell Point pool and righteous ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual (see page 275), but keep any other paladin abilities that don't require those class features.
The Paladin's Code	KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ The Paladin's Code	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:The following is the fundamental code all paladins follow. The tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren't in a no-win situation; instead, follow the most important tenet. For instance, if an evil king asked you if innocent lawbreakers were hiding in your church so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet forbidding you to lie is less important than the tenet prohibiting the harm of an innocent. An attempt to subvert the paladin code by engineering a situation allowing you to use a higher tenet to ignore a lower tenet (telling someone that you won't respect lawful authorities so that the tenet of not lying supersedes the tenet of respecting lawful authorities, for example) is a violation of the paladin code. • You must never willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting an evil spell. • You must not use actions that you know will harm an innocent, or through inaction cause an innocent immediate harm when you knew your action could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn't force you to take action against possible harm to innocents or to sacrifice your life and potential to attempt to protect an innocent. • You must act with honor, never cheating, lying, or taking advantage of others. • You must respect the lawful authority of the legitimate ruler or leadership in whichever land you may be, following their laws unless they violate a higher tenet.
Deific Weapon		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Deific Weapon		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:If your deity's favored weapon (see page 72) is uncommon, you gain access to it. If the weapon is simple, increase the damage die by one step when you wield it (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).
Retributive Strike	KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Retributive Strike	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:As a paladin, you are a stalwart protector of those under your charge. You gain the Retributive Strike reaction. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature at a -2 penalty before the opponent rolls the damage for the triggering hit. If your attack hits, the target is enfeebled 1 for the remainder of its turn, or enfeebled 2 for the remainder of its turn if your Strike was a critical hit. The enfeebled condition ends immediately if the creature makes a Strike against you. If Retributive Strike incapacitates or kills the triggering creature, the triggering hit deals no damage.
Champion Powers		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Champion Powers	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Divine power flows through you, and you have learned to channel it to heal others.

Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare each day. Your key spellcasting ability score is Charisma, and you're trained in spell rolls and spell DCs for your champion powers. Your champion powers are divine spells. Champion powers are available only to paladins, and they can't be learned by other characters. They appear in the Spells chapter (page 192). Some paladin feats grant you additional champion powers, and such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points. The spell level of each of your champion powers is equal to half your character level, rounded down, and produces heightened effects (see page 192) for those champion powers that have heightened entries. You gain the ability to cast the lay on hands champion power by spending 1 Spell Point.

Righteous Ally		KEY:Paladin Class Feature ~ Righteous Ally	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Your devotion to the cause of good attracts the attention of a holy spirit to aid you on your journey. This spirit can take many forms, each granting you abilities and advantages. Once you have chosen the ally's form, it cannot be changed. The following are righteous allies: • Blade Ally: A spirit of valor inhabits your weapon, granting it additional power. Select one weapon each morning when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the weapon gains your choice of the disrupting, ghost touch, returning, or shifting property (see page 370), without it counting against the weapon's maximum number of properties. In addition, you gain access to the weapon's critical specialization effect. • Shield Ally: A spirit of dedication inhabits your shield, granting it additional benefits. In your hands, the shield increases its Hardness by 2 and gains the ability to take 2 additional Dents before becoming broken. This stacks with any extra Dents the shield can normally take. • Steed Ally: You gain the service of a trained mount, which is treated as a young animal companion (see page 284). Normally you can select only an animal companion with the mount special ability, such as a horse. At the GM's discretion, you can select a different type of animal companion appropriate to your ancestry and culture, but it doesn't gain the mount special ability.

# Sorcerer
Bloodline			KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Bloodline			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You choose one bloodline to represent the magical ancestry that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast, the spell list from which you choose your spells, additional spells you learn, and additional signature skills you gain. You also gain Spell Points and special powers based on your bloodline. See Bloodlines on pages 129-130, and Casting Spells on pages 195-196.
Sorcerer Spellcasting	KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Sorcerer Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You have the power to cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Casting Spells on pages 195-196). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace Material Casting actions with Somatic Casting actions, so you usually don't need spell components. Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells, plus an extra 1st-level spell due to the power of your bloodline. The number of spells you can cast each day are called your spell slots. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table on page 129. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells	KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can heighten lower-level spells to higher levels. You must learn them at the new level to do so, as described on page 192. The spontaneous heightening class feature lets you select two spells you can heighten freely.
Cantrips			KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Cantrips			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1stlevel sorcerer, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level sorcerer, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Spell Repertoire		KEY:Sorcerer Class Feature ~ Spell Repertoire		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline (see page 130). You choose these from the common spells on the spell list corresponding to your bloodline in this book, or from other spells on that spell list to which you gain access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot from Table 3-20, you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. So when you reach 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and at 4th level you select a 2nd-level spell. Each time you learn spells of a new spell level, your bloodline also grants you both a new spell and a new spell slot of that level. As with other spell slots, you can use this bonus slot to cast any spell, not just the one your bloodline gave you. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you level up and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime (see page 318).

You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. If you are at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you're already an expert. If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you're already a master.

During your daily preparations (see page 192), you can pick up to two spells you know. You can cast those spells using any applicable higher-level spell slots you may have, heightening the spell to the level of spell slot used, even if you don't ordinarily know the spell at the higher level.

# BLOODLINES
# Your magical power comes from your bloodline. Choose a bloodline as the source of your power. This bloodline has a major influence on your abilities, primarily by determining your spell list and the type of spells you cast. Your bloodline also grants you bloodline powers, which are special spells unique to sorcerers of your lineage, and a pool of Spell Points you can use to cast these powers. You can cast a bloodline power only by spending 1 or more Spell Points, not by using spell slots. Like cantrips, bloodline powers are automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. At 1st level, your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier. As you gain advanced and greater bloodline powers, you also gain additional Spell Points, as indicated in your bloodline next to the power's entry. You refresh all your Spell Points during daily preparations.

# Wizard
Arcane Spellcasting	KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Arcane Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You have the power to cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and gain access to the Material Casting, Somatic Casting, and Verbal Casting actions (see Casting Spells on page 195). At 1st level you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and four cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see page 137), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare are called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, as shown on the Wizard Spells per Day table on page 137. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. See page 291 for details on calculating your spell rolls and spell DCs.
Heightening Spells	KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Heightening Spells		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can prepare lower-level spells in those slots to strengthen them (see page 192). This increases the spell's level to match the heightened spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.
Cantrips			KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Cantrips				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 1st, so your cantrips are 1st-level spells. As a 5th-level wizard, the highest level of spell you can cast is 3rd, so your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Spellbook			KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Spellbook				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less (as detailed on page 187), which you receive for free. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and eight 1stlevel arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list from this book (see page 199) or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Each time you gain a level, you automatically add two more arcane spells to your spellbook. These can be of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find, as described on page 146. If you're creating a higher-level character, it's usually easiest to assume you always picked new spells of the highest level possible. At an odd-numbered level, this means that in addition to your total of 10 cantrips, your spellbook holds two spells of your highest level and four spells of all lower levels. At an even-numbered level, it means you'd have 10 cantrips and four spells of every level.
Arcane School		KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Arcane School			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose one school of magic in which to specialize. You gain one additional spell slot for each spell level you can cast, but you may use these spell slots to prepare only spells from your arcane school. You can also prepare one additional cantrip each day, which must be from your specialized school. You gain Spell Points and a special power based on your school (see Arcane Schools on page 137) and add another spell from your chosen school to your spellbook.
Arcane Focus		KEY:Wizard Class Feature ~ Arcane Focus			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.Class Feature.Display	DESC:You can place some of your magical power into an item called an arcane focus. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your arcane focus. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Arcane Focus free action.

# If you choose to specialize in an arcane school, you gain an extra spell slot for each level of spell you can cast. You can prepare only spells of your chosen arcane school in these extra slots. In addition, you can prepare an extra cantrip of your chosen school. You also add another arcane spell of your chosen school to your spellbook. You learn a school power, a special type of spell taught to students of your arcane school. You gain a pool of Spell Points you can spend to cast school powers. You can cast a school power only by spending Spell Points, not by using spell slots. Like a cantrip, your school power is automatically heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast. Your maximum number of Spell Points is equal to your key ability modifier (minimum 0). You regain all your Spell Points when you prepare your spells. Some feats let you learn more school power; such feats typically increase your pool of Spell Points.
