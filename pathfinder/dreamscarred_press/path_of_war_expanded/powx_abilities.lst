In addition, the harbinger automatically knows the position of creatures she has Claimed. Any opponent the harbinger cannot see still has total concealment (50%% miss chance) against her, and the harbinger still suffers the normal miss chance when attacking creatures that have concealment.

The disciplines available to her are Cursed Razor, Riven Hourglass, Scarlet Throne, Shattered Mirror, and Veiled Moon. Once a harbinger knows a maneuver, she must ready it before she can use it (see Maneuvers Readied). A maneuver usable by harbingers is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in it or its discipline's description. A harbinger's maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she initiates one. The harbinger must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even numbered harbinger level thereafter, the harbinger can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one she already knows. In effect, she loses the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. She can choose a new maneuver of any level she likes, as long as she observes the restriction on highest-level maneuvers she knows; the harbinger need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. She can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.

A harbinger must always ready her maximum number of maneuvers readied.  She readies her maneuvers by meditating over the nature of malevolence, honing her killer instinct, dwelling upon grief and sorrow, or otherwise communing with her negative side for ten minutes. The maneuvers she chooses remain readied until she decides to meditate again and change them. The harbinger does not need to sleep or be rest for any long period in order to ready her maneuvers; any time she spends ten minutes in communion with her darker urges, she can change her readied maneuvers.  A harbinger begins an encounter with all her readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times she might have already used them since she chose them. When she initiates a maneuver, she expends it for the current encounter, so each of her readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless she recovers them, as described below). In order for the harbinger to recover maneuvers, she must tap into her sorcerous malice by activating her dark claim class feature; the harbinger recovers a single expended maneuver whenever she Claims a creature, and she recovers a number of expended maneuvers equal to her harbinger initiation modifier (minimum 2) [%2 maneuvers] whenever a creature she has Claimed is reduced to 0 or less hit points.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Mystic ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MysticClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:A mystic is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, katanas and wakizashis, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	AUTO:WEAPONPROF|Katana|Wakizashi

Animus			KEY:Mystic ~ Animus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MysticClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Outside combat, a mystic has no animus to spend, but her inner power can still be used for more subtle arcane arts. Her levels in mystic count as arcane spellcaster levels for the purposes of qualifying for prerequisites (such as those of item creation feats or the Arcane Strike feat), and if a mystic ever develops arcane spellcasting from another class, she may add her mystic level to her levels in that class to determine her overall caster level for the purposes of item creation feats. When a mystic enters combat, she gains an animus pool equal to %1 at the start of her first turn, and adds one point of animus to her animus pool at the start of each of her turns thereafter. Her animus pool persists for one minute after the last enemy combatant is defeated or the encounter otherwise ends. At the end of any round in which the mystic initiates a maneuver (a strike, boost, or counter), she adds an additional point of animus to her pool. Certain abilities, such as some class features, maneuvers, and feats, require the mystic to expend points of animus to use. The primal power of animus can be used in several ways-the foremost of which is the augmentation of maneuvers. If the mystic has the ability to augment her maneuvers in other ways, such as from another class feature or the maneuver itself, this cannot be combined with the augments granted by her animus class feature; she must choose which augmentation type to use when initiating the maneuver. A mystic can spend %2 points of animus to augment a maneuver as part of that maneuver's initiation action to apply one of the effects to it (if applicable).|MysticAnimusPool|MysticAnimusSpendingLimit	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DEFINE:MysticAnimusPool|0	BONUS:VAR|MysticAnimusPool|1+MysticInitiationModifier	DEFINE:MysticAnimusSpendingLimit|0	BONUS:VAR|MysticAnimusSpendingLimit|1	BONUS:VAR|MysticAnimusSpendingLimit|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,4	BONUS:VAR|MysticAnimusSpendingLimit|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,9	BONUS:VAR|MysticAnimusSpendingLimit|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,13	BONUS:VAR|MysticAnimusSpendingLimit|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,19	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Mystic ~ Animus (Enhance Maneuver)|Mystic ~ Animus (Increase DC)	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Mystic ~ Animus (Anima Burn)|Mystic ~ Animus (Increase Potency)|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,4	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Mystic ~ Animus (Animus Rush)|Mystic ~ Animus (Increase Range)|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,9

Elemental Attunement	KEY:Mystic ~ Elemental Attunement	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MysticClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When a mystic readies her maneuvers, she may select one of the following elements (and associated energy type) to be her active element: air (electricity), earth (acid), fire (fire), and water (cold). After readying maneuvers, a mystic can change her active element by taking a standard action to focus inwards, or by expending one point of animus as a free action while assuming a new stance. Whenever she initiates a maneuver that deals damage, she may spend one point of animus as part of its initiation action to change all damage the maneuver deals to her active element's associated energy type. For example, if a mystic whose active element is currently Air initiated the Cursed Fate Veiled Moon strike, she could spend one point of animus to change her attack's damage (including the strike's bonus damage) to from her weapon's normal damage type to electricity damage. If the mystic has access to the Elemental Flux discipline, then her active element from this class feature is the same as her active element for Elemental Flux maneuvers. If she is psionic, she can change her active energy type whenever she changes her active element, and vice versa. Her active energy type need not match her active element.	SOURCEPAGE:p.12

In addition, until the start of her next turn, creatures that target the mystic with melee attacks are engulfed in the explosion of energy, taking 1d6 points of damage of her active element's associated energy type, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every two points of animus remaining in the mystic's animus pool.

Allies may only be affected by one of her glyphs at a time, with new glyphs ending the current glyph in effect and replacing it on the affected ally.

Mystic Artifice		KEY:Mystic ~ Mystic Artifice		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MysticClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When crafting an item, the mystic uses her initiator level as her caster level to determine how potent a creation she can make. If her initiator level does not equal the minimum caster level to make the item, then she cannot create the item. When attempting to create a magical item for which she does not possess a prerequisite spell, the mystic can attempt to replicate the spell through her innate power with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the level of the spell being replicated). If successful, she can create the item as if she had cast the prerequisite spell. The mystic must possess any material components necessary for casting the spell that she is replicating. If the item being created requires multiple spells, she must make this check for each spell she intends to replicate. If she fails the skill check, she may not try again for that spell while creating that item-the item creation DC increases as normal for the creation of an item without a prerequisite spell in such a case.

If that Will saving throw is successful, she is completely unaffected by the spell or power, taking no damage and suffering no ill-effects. If she fails the saving throw, she suffers the effect as normal, and adds one point of animus to her animus pool. The mystic must be unencumbered and wearing light or no armor to use this ability.

A maneuver usable by mystics is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in it or its discipline's description. A mystic's maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she initiates one. A mystic must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even numbered initiator level thereafter, the mystic can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one she already knows. In effect, she loses the old maneuver in exchange for the new one.

A mystic must always ready her maximum number of maneuvers readied.  She readies her maneuvers by meditating for ten minutes. The maneuvers she chooses remain readied until she decides to meditate again and change them. The mystic does not need to sleep or rest for any long period in order to ready her maneuvers; any time she spends ten minutes in meditation, she can change her readied maneuvers.  A mystic begins an encounter with all her readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times she might have already used them since she chose them. When she initiates a maneuver, she expends it for the current encounter, so each of her readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless she recovers them, as described below). Mystics are unique among martial disciples in that they rely on surging, primal arcane forces within their being to fuel their martial maneuvers. Because of this, they do not have full control over their readied maneuvers; when a mystic readies her maneuvers, she selects two of her readied maneuvers to be immediately granted to her for use at any time, (when these maneuvers are used outside of combat, they recover on their own in the following round), and %2 more are granted randomly.  The rest of her initially randomized maneuvers wait to be granted in combat. The remainder of her readied maneuvers are withheld and currently inaccessible until combat begins. If she is able to act in a surprise round when combat begins, she is granted her maneuvers then as normal, but if she is caught unaware, she must wait until her initiative before her maneuvers are granted (beyond the initial %3). At the end of each of her combat turns, one previously withheld maneuver (randomly determined) is granted to her, and thus becomes accessible for her next turn and subsequent turns. She can freely choose to initiate any maneuver that is currently granted when her turn begins, but she cannot initiate a withheld maneuver. If the mystic chooses not to employ a maneuver in a given round, her currently granted maneuvers remain available, and a previously withheld maneuver is granted, as described above. In other words, it doesn't matter if she uses her maneuvers or not-at the end of each of her turns, one withheld maneuver from her selection of readied maneuvers is granted to her. Over the course of a few rounds, all the mystic's maneuvers will eventually be granted. A mystic can change the two readied maneuvers she has chosen to be immediately granted for use at any time by spending one minute meditating. If, at the end of the mystic's turn, she cannot be granted a maneuver because she has no withheld maneuvers remaining, she recovers all expended maneuvers, and a new group of readied maneuvers is granted to her, replacing her previously granted maneuvers if any remain unspent. She selects two of her choice (and gains the remainder of granted maneuvers as randomized selections).

Unlike the mystic's initial granted maneuvers, these additional maneuvers are randomly determined (for example, at the beginning of an encounter, a 6th level mystic would choose two maneuvers to have access to, then randomly be granted two more).|MysticManeuversReadied|MysticInitialRandomManeuvers|2+MysticInitialRandomManeuvers	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadied|5	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,3|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.MysticManeuverReadied3	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,6|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.MysticManeuverReadied6	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,9|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.MysticManeuverReadied9	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,12|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.MysticManeuverReadied12	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,15|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.MysticManeuverReadied15	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,18|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.MysticManeuverReadied18	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadied|1|PREVARGTEQ:MysticLVL,20|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.MysticManeuverReadied20	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedOne|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,1	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedTwo|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,2	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedThree|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,3	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedFour|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,4	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedFive|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,5	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedSix|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,6	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedSeven|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,7	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedEight|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,8	BONUS:VAR|MysticManeuversReadiedNine|MysticManeuversReadied|PREVAREQ:MysticHighestManeuverLevel,9	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DEFINE:MysticInitialRandomManeuvers|0	BONUS:VAR|MysticInitialRandomManeuvers|MysticManeuversReadied-5

Collective				KEY:Zealot ~ Collective				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ZealotClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A zealot learns to use psionic power to connect willing minds through an internal network that strengthens their psychic bonds. As a standard action, a zealot can join any number of willing targets into his collective (up to his limit, see below). The zealot must have line of sight to each target, and each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1.	DESC:All targets must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per zealot level) [%1 feet].|ZealotCollectiveRange|PREVARLT:ZealotLVL,15	DESC:The collective's range is limitless on the same plane as the zealot.|PREVARGTEQ:ZealotLVL,15|PREVARLT:ZealotLVL,19	DESC:The collective's range is limitless, and reaches even across other planes and dimensions.|PREVARGTEQ:ZealotLVL,19	DESC:The collective can contain up to his zealot initiation modifier or half his zealot level (minimum 1), whichever is higher, plus the intensity of his zeal (see zeal, below) [%1 members]. The zealot is always considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against the maximum number of creatures in the collective. The zealot can choose to remove a member as a free action on his turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until the member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member. A zealot is aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy below). A zealot can initiate certain maneuvers through his collective. If a zealot maneuver specifies one or more willing targets (or is harmless) and has a range greater than personal, he can initiate this maneuver on a member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual maneuver. All other non-range restrictions still apply. If he is capable of manifesting powers, casting spells, or initiating maneuvers from a different class (as is the case for a multiclass zealot), any compatible spell, power, or maneuver with a range greater than touch can also be used through the collective. He may manifest any power with the Network descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets. If a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the collective and the zealot must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member or be sickened for an equal number of rounds.|ZealotCollectiveMembers	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DEFINE:ZealotCollectiveMembers|0	DEFINE:ZealotCollectiveRange|0	BONUS:VAR|ZealotCollectiveMembers|max(1,ZealotInitiationModifier,floor(ZealotLVL/2))	BONUS:VAR|ZealotCollectiveMembers|ZealotZealIntensity	BONUS:VAR|ZealotCollectiveRange|100+10*ZealotLVL
Zeal					KEY:Zealot ~ Zeal					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ZealotClassFeatures.ClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The zealot's martial competence and inspiring exhortations give his collective the courage to fight no matter the odds. Whenever a zealot successfully hits an opponent with a strike maneuver, all allies in his collective (including him) gain a +%1 morale bonus on attack rolls for one round. A zealot's zeal is also activated when he uses the Aid Another action as to recover maneuvers (regardless of whether or not the Aid Another attempt was successful). In addition, when he uses the Aid Another action to grant an ally a bonus on a skill check or to their AC, he adds the intensity of his zeal to the bonus granted. In addition, the zealot's ardor for his beliefs draws others to follow and support him. The zealot adds the intensity of his zeal to the maximum number of creatures he may have in his collective.|ZealotZealIntensity	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DEFINE:ZealotZealIntensity|0	BONUS:VAR|ZealotZealIntensity|1+floor(ZealotLVL/5)

When he does so, the bonus applies to an attack that comes before the end of his next turn. In addition, he can use the Aid Another action with a ranged attack as long as he is within his weapon's first range increment.	SOURCEPAGE:p.18
