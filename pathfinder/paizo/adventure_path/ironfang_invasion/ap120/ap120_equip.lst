# Magic Items
Snake Charmer's Flute		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Instrument		COST:26000		WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.19		SPROP:Can play two songs. The first song grants a +5 competence bonus on Handle Animal and Wild Empathy checks to influence snakes as well as snakelike animals and magical beasts. If the musician doesn't have Wild Empathy, she can still use this song to influence snakes and snakelike creatures as if she did, applying only her Cha modifier and the flute's +5 bonus. The second song may be used once per day as a full round action to summon an advanced giant anaconda (Bestiary 2, p292 and p252) that will obey the musician's mental commands and remains as long as the user continues to spend a move action each round to maintain the tune to a maximum of 3 minutes.
Earth's Eye					TYPE:Artifact.Minor.Headband		COST:0			WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.79		SPROP:The earth's eye is a small geode that resembles a crystalline eye that sparkles brilliantly. When the earth's eye is worn on a headband and positioned in the center of the forehead, it creates a mental bond between the wearer and all natural, unworked stone within 200 feet. By concentrating, the wearer can alter this stone in the following ways. These changes are permanent but are too gradual to damage most creatures and objects. CALCIFIC ALTERATIONS - The wearer pulls mineral-rich moisture through the stone to create stalactites, stalagmites, and similar rock formations. These formations are the same type of stone as the surrounding area, and they appear to be seamless, natural growths. This change requires 1 full round of concentration for each 5-foot square affected. CREATE HABITAT - The wearer draws forth a natural spring or pool of clear water, causes edible molds or fungi to sprout, or opens narrow vents that bring in fresh air from elsewhere. This change requires 1 full round of concentration for each 5-foot square affected. CRYSTALLINE FORMS - The wearer transforms stone into translucent crystal. Sighted creatures can see through up to 30 feet of translucent crystal; thicker crystal is too cloudy to see through. The wearer can also transform nonmagical crystal into ordinary stone. This change requires 1 minute of concentration for each 5-foot square affected. REDUCE STONE - The wearer can remove stone entirely, but the resulting open space appears natural. Anything previously supported by stone that was removed entirely-such as a cavern ceiling-collapses. This change requires 1 minute of concentration for each 5-foot square affected. STONE TELL - The wearer can cause a 5-foot-square area of stone to ripple slightly, displaying momentary images of creatures and objects that have touched, used, or passed by the stone. This functions as stone tell but works only on natural stone. This requires 10 minutes of concentration. NOTE - The earth's eye does not function when in natural sunlight.
Tentacle of the Vaults		TYPE:Artifact.Minor					COST:0			WT:8		SOURCEPAGE:p.80		SPELLS:Tentacle of the Vaults|TIMES=5|CASTERLEVEL=20|Dispel Magic|Remove Disease		SPROP:The tentacle is 8 feet in length and too rubbery and flexible to carry comfortably; humanoids find it more convenient to wear the tentacle of the Vaults wrapped around the waist like a belt or over the shoulder as a sash, but no matter how the tentacle is worn, it does not occupy a magic item slot. The tentacle's owner can cast dispel magic and remove disease each five times per day. The tentacle's primary power activates when its owner tosses it onto the ground and speaks a command word as a standard action. The tentacle animates, transforming into a construct with the statistics listed in the paragraph below until the owner commands the construct to return to an inanimate tentacle as a free action. The construct obeys and serves its owner. It understands all languages spoken by its owner but does not speak. If the construct is destroyed, the artifact reverts to an inanimate tentacle that can be used again at a later time. The tentacle of the Vaults can be animated for up to 1 hour each day. This time does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

# Magic Weapons
Hammer of Seismic Assault	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Warhammer		TYPE:Weapon.Magic.Resizable.Melee.OneHanded.Martial.Specific.Bludgeoning.Hammer		COST:80000	WT:5	SOURCEPAGE:p.32		CRITMULT:x3		CRITRANGE:1		DAMAGE:2d6		WIELD:OneHanded		SIZE:M		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +3 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Impact ~ Weapon		SPROP:This +3 impactUE warhammer deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage when it hits. As a swift action, the wielder can will the hammer's crystalline head to grow jagged spikes, switching its damage type to piercing for a single blow. When the bearer confirms a critical hit with the hammer of seismic assault, a concussive blast emits from the hammer in a 10-foot-radius spread, causing a tremor to rip through the ground. Any creatures standing on the ground in this area with a CMD equal to or lower than the result of the confirmation roll are knocked prone. This damaged area is considered rough terrain for 10 minutes.
Spear.COPY=Spear of Shards
Spear of Shards.MOD												TYPE:Weapon.Artifact.Minor.Resizable.Melee.TwoHanded.Simple.Specific.Piercing.Spear		COST:0		WT:10		SOURCEPAGE:p.81		EQMOD:Special Ability ~ +6 ~ Weapon.Special Ability ~ Returning ~ Thrown.Special Ability ~ Wounding ~ Weapon		SPROP:The large crystal composing the spear's head is mounted on a 5-foot shaft of lightweight metal that swirls with a complex pattern that every so often appears to shift. A ring designed to fit a dozen smaller teardrop-shaped crystals connects the base of the spear's head to the shaft, although only seven of the 12 sockets contain a crystal. Each of these smaller crystals is about an inch long and angles slightly outward on one side of the ring to act like barbs when the spear is lodged deeply in flesh. Each of these crystals pulses with a warm amber light. Any xiomorn within 1 mile of the spear of shards is automatically aware of its presence, as well as the distance and direction to the artifact. Each of the smaller crystals is attuned to a different Vault beneath Golarion. When the wielder of the spear of shards rhythmically taps one of these smaller crystals as a full-round action, the spear identifies the path to the attuned Vault and can direct its wielder unerringly to the Vault, as per find the path. This effect lasts until the spear reaches the attuned Vault or until the crystal at the head of the spear is tapped in the same manner. The five missing crystals are lost but, if rediscovered, could be attached to the spear of shards and reveal the way to their attuned Vaults as well. The spear of shards has sufficient intelligence to remain staunchly loyal to its xiomorn creators. If wielded by a non-xiomorn, it either refuses to provide directions or intentionally provides erroneous directions to keep the wielder away from the Vaults. If used by a nonxiomorn in combat, the spear of shards damages the wielder rather than the target on any attack roll that is a natural 1, as a cursed backbiter spear. When the spear of shards is used by a non-xiomorn in combat against a xiomorn, any attack roll other than a natural 20 results in an attack against the wielder instead. A non-xiomorn can use the Use Magic Device skill to emulate a xiomorn and trick the spear of shards, but the DC of this check is increased by 10 (to DC 35) to reflect the spear's suspicion.
