Fungal Blisters			TYPE:Arcane.Divine			CLASSES:Alchemist,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=2			SCHOOL:Transmutation		COMPS:V,S			CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until discharged (see text)			SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.70			DESC:When you cast this spell, horrible, fungal growths sprout forth all over your body. You develop 1d2+1 of these blisters per 2 caster levels. Each time you are dealt more than 5 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a single attack, one of these blisters bursts, releasing a cloud of harmful spores in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on you. These spores enter the lungs of all living creatures within the cloud that need to breathe and deal 1d6+1 points of damage for every 2 caster levels you have (Fortitude negates). This is a disease effect, and you and plants aren't affected by the spores. It is possible for more than one blister to burst in a single round. If you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, all remaining blisters burst, and the resulting spores deal the cumulative amount of damage. You are not able to cast this spell while wearing heavy armor. If you don heavy armor during the spell's duration, all remaining blisters burst as if you had been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. 
Sebaceous Twin			TYPE:Arcane.Divine			CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=3			SCHOOL:Transmutation		COMPS:V,S			CASTTIME:1 standard action		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:living creature touched		DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (see text)								SAVEINFO:None (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.70			DESC:By touching a living target, you cause a half-formed, parasitic clone of the target to burst from its midsection. The twin dangles from the target's body, making it difficult for the target to move easily and imparting a -2 penalty on Acrobatics and Climb checks. In addition, for the spell's duration, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn each round, or else it takes 1 point of Constitution damage and is sickened for that round as the twin siphons off its blood. Each time the target receives any healing (magical or otherwise), the duration of this spell is extended by 1 round. Each attack that deals damage to the target reduces the duration of this spell by 1 round. If the duration reaches 0 rounds in this manner, the twin is violently excised from the body, and the target takes 1d6 points of bleed damage (which can be healed as normal). The effect of sebaceous twin counts as a disease effect with a DC equal to the spell's saving throw DC.
