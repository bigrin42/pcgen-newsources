Taldan Patriot			KEY:Trait ~ Taldan Patriot			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability.Trait ~ Taldan Patriot],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]																													CSKILL:Sense Motive|Knowledge (History)		BONUS:SKILL|Sense Motive,Knowledge (History)|1|TYPE=Trait		SOURCEPAGE:p.9																																																																																																	DESC:You gain a +1 bonus on all Sense Motive and Knowledge (history) checks, and these skills are always class skills for you.

Young Reformer			KEY:Trait ~ Young Reformer			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Trait.CampaignTrait		PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability.Trait ~ Young Reformer],[PREVAREQ:BypassTraitRestriction,1],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.CampaignTrait]			STACK:NO	MULT:YES		SELECT:1	CHOOSE:NUMCHOICES=1|SKILL|Disable Device|Knowledge (Local)					CSKILL:LIST									BONUS:SKILL|Disable Device,Knowledge (Local)|1|TYPE=Trait		SOURCEPAGE:p.10																																																																																																	DESC:You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you can call upon your coconspirators to have "made arrangements" on your behalf, allowing you to attempt a Knowledge (local) check in place of a single Bluff, Disable Device, Intimidate, or Sleight of Hand check. The DC of this Knowledge (local) check is equal to the DC of the skill check it replaces. Whatever arrangements you make-for doors left unlocked, guards strong-armed out of your way, stolen keys left for you to find-must be reasonable to have anticipated and achieved beforehand; you could arrange to have a noble convinced you're a very important diplomat traveling in disguise, for example, but if a fight breaks out you could not rely on your network of contacts to feint for you in combat. You don't have to use this ability in advance; you can announce its use as you encounter a challenge, implying you foresaw this challenge and made arrangements prior to your arrival.
