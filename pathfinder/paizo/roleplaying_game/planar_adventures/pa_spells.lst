A creature can be affected by anywhere but here only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets can, by chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell). Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is determined by the table below; the location on the destination plane where the transported creatures arrive is completely subject to the GM's whim. [d%%] Planar Destination; [1-7] Abyss [8-14] Abaddon [15-20] Hell [21-24] Shadow Plane [25-28] First World [29-35] Maelstrom [36-42] Boneyard [43-49] Axis [50-56] Ethereal Plane [57-63] Elysium [64-70] Nirvana [71-77] Heaven [78-84] Astral Plane [85-90] Random demiplane [91-95] Material Plane (random world) [96-100] GM's choice. A creature that is transported by anywhere but here cannot be affected by a subsequent casting of anywhere but here for 24 hours afterward (but can be affected normally by other forms of planar travel).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

[Hit Dice Effect] Equal to caster level - Sickened; Up to caster level -1 - Sickened, staggered; Up to caster level -5 - Nauseated, sickened, staggered; Up to caster level -10 - Killed, nauseated, sickened, staggered. The effects are concurrent. A creature can attempt a Will save to reduce or negate the effects. If subject to multiple effects, the creature rolls once and applies the result to each effect. [Sickened] The creature is sickened for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). [Staggered] The creature is staggered for 2d4 rounds, or for 1d4 rounds on a successful Will save. [Nauseated] The creature is nauseated for 1d10 minutes, or for 1d4 rounds on a successful Will save. [Killed] Living creatures die, and undead creatures are destroyed. On a successful Will save, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, all chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good extraplanar creatures within the area are banished to their home planes (Will negates, at a -4 penalty). Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the arbitrament.

The spell deals min(5,CASTERLEVEL/2)d8 points of damage to creatures whose alignment is neutral with no other alignment components (with the exception of neutral outsiders, who take min(10,CASTERLEVEL)d6 points of damage). Neutral outsiders are also nauseated for 1d6 rounds. A creature can attempt a Will save to halve the damage and negate the nauseated effect. The spell deals half damage against creatures that are chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good, and such targets are not nauseated. On a successful Will save, such a creature reduces the damage to one-quarter the damage rolled.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The touched creature gains that plane's basic infusion for the spell's duration. This spell has no effect if cast on the Material Plane, and it ends as soon as the spell's target leaves the plane with which it has been infused. Details on planar infusions can be found in each plane's Infusion section, as presented in Chapter 3 of this book. Once a creature gains the benefits of bestow planar infusion I, it remains attuned to that plane for 24 hours. Additional castings of bestow planar infusion I during this time bestow the same infusion that was granted by the initial casting that day. Planar infusions that can be used a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by multiple castings of bestow planar infusion I.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

On standard planes, the spell operates with a radius of (CASTERLEVEL) miles. On demiplanes, the spell is less powerful, and its radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level.

This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. This benefit applies against all attacks and effects, not just attacks by neutral creatures. Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 23 against spells cast by chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures, and spell resistance 27 against spells cast by neutral creatures with no other alignment components. Third, the spell protects warded creatures from possession and influence by such creatures (otherwise as protection from evil). Finally, if a chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good creature successfully hits a warded creature with a melee attack, the attacker is sickened for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude negates). If a neutral creature successfully hits a warded creature with a melee attack, the attacker is instead nauseated for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude negates).

First, you gain a +3 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures. Against attacks by creatures whose alignment is neutral with no other alignment components, this deflection bonus is instead +5. Second, upon making a successful melee touch attack against a creature from another plane with a neutral component to its alignment, you can banish that creature back to its home plane. The creature's spell resistance applies to this attempt, and the creature can negate this effect with a successful Will save. If the creature's alignment is neutral with no other alignment components, the creature takes a -2 penalty on this saving throw. This use discharges and ends the spell. Third, with a touch, you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by a creature with a neutral component to its alignment. Spells that can't be dispelled by dispel magic also can't be dispelled by dispel balance. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Hasten Judgment			TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Psychic	CLASSES:Antipaladin,Inquisitor,Spiritualist=4|Cleric,Druid,Witch=5|Sorcerer,Wizard=6				SCHOOL:Necromancy							DESCRIPTOR:Curse		CASTTIME:1 standard action			COMPS:V,S,M		RANGE:Touch									TARGETAREA:One living or corporeal undead creature													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days									SAVEINFO:Will negates							SPELLRES:Yes	SOURCEPAGE:p.40				SOURCELINK:http://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Hasten%20Judgement			DESC:This potent curse weighs upon the target's soul, hastening a living creature's journey to the Boneyard upon death or weakening an undead creature's animating force. A living creature that dies during the spell's duration cannot be affected by breath of life or similar effects, and the period during which attempts to restore the target to life can succeed is reduced to 1 hour/level (for raise dead), 1 day/level (for resurrection), or 10 days/level (for true resurrection). Reincarnate and similar effects work normally on a creature killed under this spell's effects. An undead creature affected by this spell cannot gain temporary hit points, and any existing channel resistance the undead may have is reduced by half as long as the curse persists. Creatures whose souls are separate from their bodies (such as liches) or are merged with their bodies (such as non-native outsiders) are unaffected by hasten judgment.

When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain's benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell's DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round-this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell's duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end. You must worship a single divinity in order to cast this spell, even if you do not normally cast divine spells. If you perform an action that blatantly violates your deity's precepts while under this spell's effects, invoke deity immediately ends and you are stunned for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Invoke deity has the same alignment descriptors ([chaotic], [evil], [good], or [lawful]) as your deity's alignment. If an ability duplicates a spell, it functions as that spell heightened to a level equal to your invoke deity spell.

Judgment Undone			TYPE:Divine.Psychic		CLASSES:Cleric,Psychic,Shaman=9													SCHOOL:Necromancy											CASTTIME:10 minutes				COMPS:V,S,M,F	RANGE:Touch									TARGETAREA:One willing petitioner																DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:None								SPELLRES:No		SOURCEPAGE:p.43	DESCISPI:YES	SOURCELINK:http://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Judgement%20Undone			DESC:This powerful, elaborate, and risky spell undoes Pharasma's judgment, returning a willing petitioner to its mortal life. This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell's casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact. &nl;  The casting of judgment undone is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell's 10-minute casting time, an olethros (B6) appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless judgment undone has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM's discretion. &nl;  The caster of judgment undone can pause the spell's casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on judgment undone and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails. &nl;  It is possible to cast judgment undone without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM's discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast judgment undone is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it's not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell's casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell's material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma's code of conduct.

Each creature damaged by positive energy in the area (such as undead) must succeed at a Will save or take 1d6+ min(5,CASTERLEVEL/2) points of damage. Haunts manifesting in the spell's area also take this damage. This spell does not heal creatures healed by positive energy; such creatures instead gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, negative energy, and effects directly caused by haunts. This bonus lasts for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Quintessence Mastery		TYPE:Arcane.Divine		CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Witch,Wizard=8												SCHOOL:Transmutation										CASTTIME:1 round or 4 hours; see text	COMPS:V,S,F		RANGE:Personal or up to (10*CASTERLEVEL) 10-ft. cubes [S]	TARGETAREA:Control over a plane's terrain and traits													DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or (CASTERLEVEL) days; see text																SOURCEPAGE:p.43				SOURCELINK:http://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Quintessence%20Mastery		DESC:This spell grants the caster limited control over the quintessence of an Outer Plane. The control granted by quintessence mastery can take one of two forms, depending on the version of the spell cast. Both versions can be cast only on one of the nine Outer Planes, for it is these planes, not the Transitive or Inner Planes, that are comprised of quintessence. &nl;  [Planewarp] This allows the caster to create various objects or effects. When this spell is cast, you can replicate a number of effects from one or more of the following spells: control water, diminish plants, fog cloud, major creation, move earth, plant growth, secure shelter, soften earth and stone, spike growth, spike stones, stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wall of stone, or wall of thorns. The total spell levels of effects to be created must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of fog cloud, secure shelter, and soften earth and stone (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or diminish plants and spike stones (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not move earth and plant growth (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level-control water, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it's a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM's discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for (CASTERLEVEL) hours or until its effects are expended. &nl;  [Shape Realm] This functions similarly to create demiplane (UM), except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by the plane's traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained. At the GM's discretion, additional restrictions beyond those listed in the create demiplane spell may limit this spell's effects, and additional options for customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for (CASTERLEVEL) days. This version of quintessence mastery can be made permanent in the same way and for the same cost as create demiplane. This version of quintessence mastery does not function within the boundaries of a divine realm.

Shadow Invasion			TYPE:Arcane				CLASSES:Magus,Sorcerer,Summoner,Wizard=4												SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning						CASTTIME:1 standard action			COMPS:V,S,F		RANGE:30 ft.

This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the shadow subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as shadow evocation) have their reduced effects increased by 20%% (to a maximum of 90%%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of shadow invasion. In addition, the rift created by shadow invasion has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When shadow invasion is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 185) will be summoned under the caster's command (as per summon monster V). This chance is 5%% for every full round that shadow invasion was active. If the caster level of shadow invasion is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutor (B3) kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of shadow invasion would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors.

If you cast songbird during the same round in which you attempt a Perform check, songbird acts as accompaniment and grants a +3 bonus on that Perform check. If you cast songbird in the same round in which you activate a bardic performance, that round of bardic performance does not count against your total rounds of bardic performance available for the day.

You must either unambiguously identify the soul you seek or use the skull of the body the soul vacated as a focus. If the subject does not share your alignment, the soul can attempt a Will save to resist this spell's effects as if it were still alive. If the subject is still alive or its soul has been destroyed, this spell fails without providing any information. If the soul has not yet been judged and moved on to its final reward or punishment, soulseeker provides an estimate of its location; in most cases, this is somewhere in the River of Souls or the Boneyard. While this may assist in physically traveling to the soul's location, especially in cases involving effects such as soul bind or a devourer's devour soul ability, the spell's primary purpose is to identify how long the subject has been dead (and what form of life-restoring magic is necessary). If the soul has already been judged, soulseeker instead identifies the plane to which the soul has been sent as a petitioner and the petitioner's general location on that plane (such as "Elysium, beneath the boughs of the Witchwood"). If soulseeker is cast on the same plane on which the soul's new petitioner form currently exists, it guides you along the shortest, most direct physical route to the petitioner, as described in find the path.

To cast this spell, you must be at the soul's place of death or be in the soul's presence, whether it is contained in a receptacle, powers an intelligent magic item, or other possibilities. The soul can attempt a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive. A soul contacted this way can speak normally in any language it knows. Unlike speak with dead and similar spells, you are not limited to asking questions and can engage in normal conversation with the soul (and vice versa). The soul isn't an undead creature and isn't compelled to speak or be truthful. Generally, the soul only knows what it knew in life, although souls that persisted with awareness of their surroundings after death may have more to offer.
